	                        <p>Drawing on contemporary Asian American film, video and literature, this interdisciplinary seminar for K-12 teachers will provide participants with a twenty-first century perspective on Asian American cultural production and communities in New York City. Against the backdrop of generation-shifting conversations around immigration reform, demographic change, and the ascendancy of Asian American writers and filmmakers, the seminar will examine Asian American communities and the arts in new and critical ways, and in so doing locate teaching tools which harness the complexity, diversity and dynamism of this rapidly growing population. All materials will examine these questions through the lens of New York City – that multicultural urban social laboratory which has for centuries acted as the crucible from which American identity has been shaped and challenged.</p>
	                        <p>The two-week seminar will meet Monday through Friday for morning, afternoon, and occasional evening sessions, with readings, lectures and seminar discussion interwoven with relevant field visits.</p>

	                    <p>Immigrant communities in the U.S., whether first or fifth generation, with homelands from Africa to Asia, face the challenge and promise of defining what it is to be “American” – a dynamic term understood on mythic levels and on intimately personal ones as well. Indeed, this negotiation is, in fact, at the heart of what it is to be American. Contemporary Asian American filmmakers and writers are on the frontlines of chronicling this experience. The multitude of stories told by the children of immigrants, or by immigrants themselves – international students, refugees, adoptees, or simply those looking for a better life – are a microcosm of how American society generates itself, and these stories define what it is to be Asian American today.</p>
	                    <p>New York City is today home to the largest and most dynamic Asian American population of any city in the U.S., representing more than 20 countries and speaking at least 45 languages and dialects. Although the state of California continues to be home to the nation’s largest population of Asian Americans, New York City has in the past two decades seen a 110% growth in its Asian American population. With approximately 1.2 million Asian American New Yorkers, constituting more than 13% of the city’s population, the rapid and ongoing transformation of New York City’s Asian American population provides a unique illustration of contemporary Asian America. The hallmarks of New York City’s cultural identity -- its multiculturalism, racial diversity, and interdisciplinarity -- combined with perhaps the highest density of working artists of any American city, present an engaging and useful setting to understand the contemporary identity of Asian America and the transformation of the faces of America.</p>
	                    <p>The Asian American canon in both film and literature has historically been built around Asian American experience on the west coast. Although that area continues to warrant scholarly and artistic attention, an emerging area for Asian American scholars across disciplines is the terrain termed simply “East of California.” As a result of nineteenth and early twentieth century migration patterns, formative Asian American communities settled in Hawai’i and the west coast of the U.S. mainland; consequently, cultural production extending out of those communities was, and to a degree continues to be, at the center of the field of Asian American Studies. Seminal works of Asian American literature and film emerged from these communities, including the first anthology of Chinese American and Japanese American literature, The Big Aiiieeeee!, and Wayne Wang’s San Francisco film noir Chan Is Missing.</p>
	                    <p>However, since the early twenty-first century, and in particular after 9/11, an area of examination around so-called “new demographics” has emerged from New York; it has opened up new ways of addressing Asian America from the frameworks of Muslim and South Asian communities, urban studies, and economic rights. With this scholarship has come dynamic new literary and moving-image based work, exemplified by Bushra Rehman’s novel Corona as well as the Oscar-nominated documentary Nerakhoun: The Betrayal, made by Ellen Kuras and Thavisouk Phravasath.</p>
	                    <p>Drawing on contemporary film, video, and literature produced by Asian American New Yorkers, this seminar is intended to provide a twenty-first century counterpoint to an increasingly inaccurate mainstream narrative around Asian American experience – upwardly mobile, California-centric, of East Asian ancestry. The stories of contemporary Asian America represent a broad cross-section of countries of origin – Bangladesh, Nepal, Trinidad, the Philippines – and intersect with pressing cultural and socioeconomic concerns – citizenship status, poverty, human trafficking, gang violence. New York’s Asian American cultural producers contest normative conceptions of “Asian America” in new and critical ways, and this seminar provides participants with an important opportunity to examine this emergent work and return to the classroom equipped with new tools and understandings of U.S. multicultural literature and film.</p>

									<h4>Morning Session: 9am – 1pm (<em>Hunter College</em>)</h4>

									<h6>Mapping Asian American Literatures East of California</h6>
									<p>Lecture and discussion with <strong>Jennifer Hayashida</strong> focusing on the subject of Asian American literature “east of California” in relation to Asian American literary production on the west coast. Emphasis will be placed on giving participants historical and theoretical context for deeply analyzing regionally inflected thematic and aesthetic differences within the category of “Asian American literature.”</p>

									<h6>Screening: Missing Asian America</h6>
									<p>Screening of <em>Chan Is Missing</em> (Wayne Wang, 1982) with lecture and discussion by <strong>Chi-hui Yang</strong></p>

									<p>Considered to one of the first films to depict Asian Americans in a realistic and non-stereotypical fashion, Chan Is Missing is the story of two Chinese American cabbies living in San Francisco, and their search for a mysterious character named Chan who has disappeared with their money. Although grounded in realism, the film can also be read metaphorically as an attempt by the two main characters to find more authentic images of Asian Americans that have been missing from the mainstream picture of America.</p>

									<p>Themes for this screening and discussion will include the history, aesthetics, and politics of Asian American filmmaking, with an emphasis on establishing a basic understanding of Asian American film history and theory, as well as the specific importance of Chan Is Missing as a canonical work of Asian American filmmaking; the film is included in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, citing its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance.</p>

									<h4>Morning Session: 9am – 12pm (<em>Hunter College</em>)</h4>

									<h5>Pre-Histories of Asian American Literature in NY</h5>
									<p>Lecture by <strong>Jennifer Hayashida</strong> with seminar discussion of H.T. Tsiang’s satirical and experimental novel The Hanging on Union Square, which explores Depression-era New York from the point of view of the unemployed Mr. Nut. First self-published in 1935 and re-issued by Kaya Press in 2013, the novel depicts one character’s personal and political transformation during a historical moment frequently referenced as a precedent for our economically unstable time. Themes for the session will focus on pre-histories of Asian American literature and the specifics of Tsiang’s novel – formal experimentation, immigrant identity, political fiction/satire, socioeconomic struggle, and the history of the book’s publisher, Kaya Press, originally founded in New York and now housed at the University of Southern California.</p>

									<h4>Lunch: 12pm – 1pm</h4>

									<h4>Afternoon Session: 1pm – 6pm (<em>Hunter College</em>)</h4>

									<h5>Screening: Labor and Living</h5>
									<p>Screenings of: <strong>“Take Out”</strong> (Shih-Ching Tsou and Sean Baker, 2004) and <strong>“Man Push Cart”</strong> (Ramin Bahrani, 2005) with lecture and discussion by <strong>Chi-hui Yang</strong>.</p>
									<p>Viewing of: <strong>“A Floating Population,”</strong>still photography by Annie Ling: http://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/a_floating_population</p>

									<p>The popular mythology of the American Dream is to make something from nothing and build a sustainable life from little means. From an Asian American perspective in New York City, this often means exhausting, low-wage, service-oriented labor that fuels the economy of the city: taxi drivers, restaurant workers, massage-workers. This session explores the lives of individuals who are often forgotten or unseen, but are at the leading edge of what defines “American” – lower and working class immigrants, often undocumented, who work and strive for a better life.</p>

									<p><strong>“Take Out”</strong> is a fictional, neo-realist portrait of an undocumented Chinese immigrant who works as a Chinese take-out deliveryman. As he falls behind on payments to pay back the smugglers who brought him to the U.S. (the so-called “snakeheads” who are the subject of a novel by seminar guest lecturer Ed Lin), he must go to extreme and dangerous ends to stay alive. <strong>“Man Push Cart”</strong> explores a day in the life of a Pakistani immigrant – once a rock star back home, but now selling coffee and bagels from a street cart, struggling to maintain his present and escape his past.</p>

									<p>These two films will be viewed alongside the photograph series <strong>“A Floating Population,”</strong> which documents the lives of immigrants and elderly in New York Chinatown who live in tenements and “shift beds” – beds shared between individuals who work on opposite sides of the twenty-hour clock.</p>

									<p>With these two award-winning documentaries as a starting point, this session will explore the multi-cultural reality that defines Asian American life in urban spaces, where lives intersect and mix, and identities are fluid and dynamic.</p>

									<p><strong>“A Son’s Sacrifice”</strong> explores the life of 27-year old Irman Uddin, a mixed race Bangladeshi/Puerto Rican man who struggles to take over his father’s halal butcher shop in Queens, NY and show himself to be a good Muslim and a good son. <strong>“The #7 Train: An Immigrant Journey”</strong> follows four immigrant passengers on New York’s #7 subway line, which carries a half million riders from 117 countries daily through Queens, the most culturally diverse region in the U.S.</p>

									<p>Themes for this screening and discussion include: mixed race identity, Muslim communities, masculinity, urban space. This session seeks to introduce visually the unique cultural geographies of Queens, NY, which has witnessed the majority of New York’s Asian American population growth.</p>

									<h5>Screening: Activisms and Religious Identities</h5>
									<p>Screenings of: <strong>“Article of Faith”</strong> (Christine Antonakos-Wallace, 2011) and <strong>“The Burqa Project</strong> (Muzhgan Rasul, 2014) with lecture and discussion led by <strong>Chi-hui Yang</strong>. <strong>Both filmmakers anticipated to participate</strong>.</p>

									<p>A city where private lives overlap on subways, streets and classrooms, New York is a site where cultural, religious and political differences are navigated on a daily basis. In this session, we will explore the lives of Asian American youth who take to arts and activism to negotiate their relationships to religious identity.</p>

									<p><strong>“Article of Faith”</strong> is a portrait of a Sikh American community organizer, Sonny Singh, who organizes New York City Sikh Youth to combat harassment in their schools. Named for the turban which he and many youth wear as a sign of their faith, this short film explores how “American-ness” is negotiated in a post-9/11 New York City.</p>

									<p><strong>“The Burqa Project”</strong> follows Bangladeshi American artist Ayesha Akhtar as she balances her “Bengali” and “American” sides through a political art project, which photographs men wearing burqas in public spaces in order to demonstrate the complex religious and cultural position Muslim women are situated in.</p>

									<h5><em>Corona</em></h5>
									<p>Seminar discussion of Bushra Rehman’s novel <em>Corona</em>. Themes for the day will focus on how Rehman frames South Asian American experience, looking in particular at the non-linear structure of the novel, its relationship to traditional bildungsroman narratives, and its depictions of the domestic, and local, impact of 9/11 on South Asian and Muslim communities in the U.S. Rehman will be present for the second half of the afternoon session to discuss her process of writing the novel and to field questions from seminar participants.</p>

									<h4>Morning Session: 9am – 1pm</h4>

									<h5>Screening: Art, Life and Love</h5>
									<p>Screening: <strong>“Cutie and the Boxer”</strong> (Zach Heinzerling, 2013) followed by lecture and discussion led by <strong>Chi-hui Yang</strong>. <strong>Film’s subjects to be invited to participate</strong>.</p>

									<p>To many, New York City is the land where artists – opera singers, theater performers, painters – arrive to find inspiration and fame. The city is a site of creative opportunity, and for immigrant artists, it doubles as a place for national and artistic self-definition. This session will explore New York City as complex meeting ground of these dynamics through the Oscar-nominated documentary <strong>“Cutie and the Boxer,”</strong> which follows the tumultuous lives of Japanese American artists Ushio and Noriko Shinohara. This film captures the difficulty of balancing artistic independence with familial dependence over the course of a forty-year marriage.</p>

									<p>Themes which will be covered include: family, national identity, gender roles and the creative process.</p>

									<h4>Lunch: 1pm – 2pm</h4>

									<h4>Afternoon Session: 2pm – 6pm (<em>Hunter College</em>)</h4>

									<h5>Busted in New York, Part I</h5>

									<p><em>This Is a Bust</em>, the second novel by award-winning author Ed Lin, turns the conventions of hard-boiled pulp stories on their head by exploring the unexotic and very real complexities of New York City’s Chinatown, circa 1976, through the eyes of Robert Chow, a Vietnam War veteran and a Chinese American cop. The novel is at once a murder mystery, a noir homage and a devastating, uniquely nuanced portrait of a neighborhood in flux. Lin will be on hand to map out the trajectory of his career as a writer and chronicler, in fiction, of Chinese American New York. In particular, Lin will discuss the relationship between his earlier works – the coming-of-age novella Waylaid (adapted for the screen in the 2005 film “The Motel”) and <em>This Is a Bust</em> to his more recent work, which continues to feature Robert Chow and explore the gritty realities of 1970s New York Chinatown: human trafficking, Chinese asylum-seekers, and local and national financial crisis.</p>

									<h5>The New Chinatown</h5>
									<p>Screening of <strong>“What Happened to Danny”</strong> (Mansee Kong, 2014) followed by lecture and discussion led by <strong>Chi-hui Yang</strong>. Filmmaker <strong>Mansee Kong</strong> will be present for discussion.</p>

									<p>Complicating and expanding on popular notions of the cultural history of New York’s Chinatown, this session will use as a starting point Kong’s feature documentary about the short life of 19-year old Army Private Danny Chen, who died in 2011 after being hazed by his supervisors in Afghanistan. Born and raised in Chinatown, and the son of immigrants from China, Chen was understood to be the victim of racial bullying by his fellow soldiers, which prompted a year-long campaign by Chinatown advocates to seek justice for his death.</p>

									<p>This session will establish Chinatown as a site where contemporary politics of US militarism, racial discrimination and working class dynamics play out – where a certain, fragile, definition of being “American” can be made, but can fail to follow an individual abroad. Themes of bullying, community activism, racial discrimination and masculinity will be explored.</p>

									<h4>Lunch: 1pm – 2pm</h4>

									<h4>Afternoon Session: 1pm – 5pm (<em>Hunter College</em>)</h4>

									<h5>Screening: Refugees in America</h5>
									<p>Screening of: <strong>“The Betrayal”</strong> (Ellen Kuras and Thaviskouk Phrasavath, 2008), lecture and discussion led by <strong>Chi-hui Yang</strong>. <strong>Phrasavath</strong> to be invited to attend.</p>
									<p>Reading of: <strong>“Stepped out of the Womb: A Memoir of a Journey to the Land where the Sun Falls,”</strong> Thavisouk Phrasavath, 2010.</p>

									<p>Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary, and made over the course of twenty years, <strong>“The Betrayal”</strong> is the epic story of the Phrasavath family, who were forced to leave Laos as refugees during the Vietnam War, settling on the streets of Brooklyn in the early 1980s. Co-directed with primary subject Thavisouk Phrasavath, the film explores the deep American involvement in the Vietnam War which resulted in their exodus, and the second war his family encountered in the U.S., establishing themselves as citizens and Americans.</p>

									<p>This session will explore the relationship between immigrants and homelands, and New York as a site where the traumas of war and displacement must be reconciled as refugees embark on new lives with the memories of past ones still fresh in their minds. Linkages will be made between the experiences of refugees who arrived, like the Phrasavath family, in the early 1980s, and the Afghani and Iraqi refugees who continue to arrive in the U.S. today.</p>
